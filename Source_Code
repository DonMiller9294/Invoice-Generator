```python
def main():
    # Sample data for the invoice
    customer = "Johnnie Matthews"
    products = ["Product A", "Product B", "Product C"]
    prices = [50.00, 30.00, 20.00]

    print_invoice(customer, products, prices)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

Replace the `customer`, `products`, and `prices` variables with your desired data to generate customized invoices.
